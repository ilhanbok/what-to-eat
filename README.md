# What To Eat

CS 506 (Software Engineering)<br />
Spring 2020 Project

## Introduction

These days people go out to eat a lot with different reasons and events. Also,
people choose the restaurant with various factors such as taste, mood, and occasion.
When they dine out, different people value over different criteria. There are many
restaurant applications, such as Yelp and UrbanSpoon. Many of them recommend the
restaurant by the distance or time of the meal, such as breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Also,
people need to read each review to decide on a restaurant. Therefore, it is hard to know
about restaurant specialties at first glance, unless the user reads multiple reviews. The
goal of this application is to recommend suitable restaurants as considering the exact
needs of the users and giving less burden to read multiple reviews.
